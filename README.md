# IntelxPlugin
This Python script for the IntelX SDK processes JSON search results, stores them in an SQLite database, and automates intelx.py command execution. It retrieves systemid and bucket values to download data and moves .bin files to a specified output directory. Features include dynamic JSON parsing and duplicate prevention.
